Programming Language: Python 2.4
Code Structure:

Implemented minmax algorithm with alpha beta pruning which is depth limited.
My code constructs the tree based on the input and the mentioned depth,
It gets an optimal move against the opponent and makes the move based on
alpha beta pruning.

Code Execution:
For Interactive Mode:
python maxconnect4.py interactive input2.txt computer-next 5

For One-Move Mode:
python maxconnect4.py one-move input1.txt output1.txt 10
